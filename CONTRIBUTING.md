# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LinuxToys! This project aims to provide a collection of tools for Linux in a user-friendly way, making powerful functionality accessible to all users.

## Documentation

Before getting started, please review the [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/psygreg/linuxtoys/wiki/Knowledge-Base) for complete documentation on LinuxToys' libraries and development practices.

**Important:** You must explicitly follow the instructions provided in all `README.md` files located in the project directories. These files contain essential guidelines for specific components of the project.

**Like those:**
- [dev/README.md](dev/README.md)
- [dev/build/README.md](dev/build/README.md)
- [dev/libs/README.md](dev/libs/README.md)

**Note:** More `README.md` files may be added in the future. If any `README.md` file is not present in a directory, please follow the instructions provided in the [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/psygreg/linuxtoys/wiki/Knowledge-Base).

## Development Priorities

When contributing to LinuxToys, please keep these core priorities in mind, listed in order of importance:

### 1. Safety and Privacy First
- **User safety and privacy must always be the top priority**
- All scripts and tools should be thoroughly tested and reviewed
- Never implement features that could compromise user data or system security
- Clearly document any potential risks or system changes
- Follow secure coding practices and validate all user inputs

### 2. User Friendliness and Accessibility
- Design with the average computer user in mind
- Provide clear, intuitive interfaces
- Include helpful descriptions and guidance for all features, while keeping it straight to the point
- Ensure accessibility for users with different technical skill levels
- Use plain language in user-facing text and error messages

### 3. Reliability and Self-Sufficiency
- **All features must work as intended without requiring additional workarounds from the user**
- Tools should handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide clear error messages when something goes wrong
- Test across supported distributions and versions
- Ensure dependencies are properly managed and documented

### 4. CLI Tool Restrictions
- **Command-line interfaces should be restricted to developer and sysadmin use cases**
- The average computer user doesn't know or want to deal with terminal emulators
- CLI-only features should be restricted to Developer and System Administration menus

## Contribution Guidelines

- All Pull Requests will be manually reviewed before approval
- Ensure your contributions align with the development priorities listed above
- Test your changes across different Linux distributions when possible
- Follow the existing code style and structure
- Document any new features or significant changes
